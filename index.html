        <h3>Timeline of events for Jimmy's life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1973: The earliest flashback we see of Jimmy. He witness his father be ripped off and then begins stealing from his father's register. </li>
            <li>1992: We witness Jimmy as a prior persona to Saul, "Slippin' Jimmy". "Slippin' Jimmy" is running around conning people around Chicago until he is arrested.  </li>
            <li>2002: McGill tries to start his law practice but ends up tangled with Nacho Varga and Tuco Salamanca.</li>
            <li>2003: McGill and his brother, Chuck, end up in a battle of law with one another for forgery. McGill gets suspended from practicing law. Chuck finds out that he was 100% correct about Jimmy and after many things, ends up taking his own life. </li>
            <li>2004: McGill, now able to practice law again, takes up the mantle Saul goodman. A lot happens this year. Too imporant of detail so I will exclude them. Kim leaves Jimmy.</li>
            <li>2005: In the wake of Kim's departure, Jimmy fully embraces Saul Goodman.</li>
            <li>2008 - 2010: Saul meets Walker White and Jesse Pinkman and becomes their crooked lawyer. That is, until he has to flee.</li>
            <li>2010: Saul becomes Gene Takovic, hiding out as a manager of a cinnabon in Omaha, Nebraska. Takovic eventually finds himself conning again until he gets arrested. He faces serious jail time after throwing away his deal, throwing away the persona of Saul Goodman, for good.</li>
        </ul>
